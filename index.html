          <h3> What <em>is</em> coffee? </h3>
            <p>
              Ahhhh, coffee. Coffee is an unofficial sponsor of weekdays.
              It can turn the groggiest person into an alert and active one!
            </p>
            <p>
              Okay, in all seriousness, coffee in our everyday sense is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans, and is prepared in several different ways
              all across the world. Some people prefer it plain, while others prefer to add milk, cream, sugar, spices, and several other additions.
              However, the National Coffee Association defines coffee as the berries harvested from a tropical plant.

          <h4>Origins</h4>
            <p>
              The when and how coffee was discovered is largely unknown. Several stories and legends 
              exist to explain its origins. One thing that is for certain, is all coffee grown around the globe can be traced
              back to modern-day Ethiopia.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a legend dated back to the third century AD, telling us how a goat shepherd noticed the change in behavior of his
              goats after they consumed these "energizing" berries. Over time, during the 15th century, knowledge of the energizing "berries" spread from 
              Ethiopia to the Arabian peninsula, Yemen to be exact, where coffee was first cultivated and domesticated. Here, the coffee trade 
              and human caffeination took off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of caffeination, the energizing properties of coffee are due to a special organic molecule named <em>caffeine</em>.
              As a stimulant, caffeine acts on the Central Nervous System which affects a person's cognitive function.

          <h5>The Caffea plant</h5>
          <p>
            Most of us may recognize a roasted coffee bean, but we may be unfamiliar with the actual plant itself!

            Coffee comes from the berries of <em>Caffea</em> plants, an evergreen shrub with
            green leaves, white flowers, and fleshy, red fruit where the seeds (coffee beans) are located.
